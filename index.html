      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="assets/images/nickpic.png" alt="nickpic" height="200" width="125">
        <p>I was born in Dallas on May 10th of 1995. I was raised in Coppell,Texas until the age of 13 when I moved to Roanoke,Texas.
        I have always had a profound interest in computers and technology ever since I can remember. I was always playing baseball and working out, but the other side of me was a complete geek.
        If I had any down time, there was no doubt I'd be on my computer either gaming, or just researching and learning about things I had no knowledge of. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Writing code and programming is one thing I've always had an interest in and wanted to learn more about. After working 6 days a week since I was 18 years old, I've decided to make an attempt to change my life at the age of 24. I decided to enroll in SMU's programming/web development bootcamp. So far, I believe it is the best decision I have made in my life!
        <br>
        <br>
        My goals for the future are to get involved with the tech industry and make a difference. My dream is to ultimately develop something that will help people and be used by millions.
